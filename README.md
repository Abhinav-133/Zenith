## 🛠️ How It Works

1. Each device becomes a **node** in the mesh using its hotspot or local network.
2. Nodes **discover peers** automatically through broadcast or scanning.
3. Messages are relayed across the mesh until they reach the intended recipient.
4. The network **self-heals** if a node drops or goes offline.
